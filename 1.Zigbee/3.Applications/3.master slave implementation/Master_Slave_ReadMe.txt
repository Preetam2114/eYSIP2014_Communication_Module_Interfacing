	In this Video we have made a slave robot follow a master robot. The master robot has a white line follower installed in it through which it'll follow a white line. Then the slave will follow this master and do all that the master does.		IMPLEMENTATION			First upload the master program attached in this folder into the spark V robot, this is your master robot now. Then load the slave program 			into a spark V robot, this is your slave robot now. The structure for master slave implementation is now ready.	Place the slave robot on any plane and on it. Then place the master on a white line and on it. You'll see that as the master follows a white line, the slave will mimic it accordingly.
