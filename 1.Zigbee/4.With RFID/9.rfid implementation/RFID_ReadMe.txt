	In this video we have transmitted RFID data over zigbee

	Since every RFID has  unique serial number called tag, we have transmitted this serial number over zigbee and as given in the program we have stored
one RFID tag in program of one robot. Similarly you'll need to store different RFIDs in different programs and upload these to respective robots. When 
the RFID tag is swiped that robot will move forward which has the RFID tag of that swiped RFID stored in its program.
		
		IMPLEMENTATION
			In order to implement this program first open the program and store that RFID tag into the program on swiping which you need your robot
		move and upload the same in your program. Similarly store and upload different RFID tags in different programs and upload them in different 
		robots.
			Now take zigbee modules as many as one plus as many robots you have configured since the extra one needs to be connected to the RFID server.
		Make the destination address of zigbee module attached to server same as source address of the zigbee module mounted on the robots.
			Connect the RX TX pins of zigbee to be connected to RFID server to TX RX pins of RFID server respectively. The RX TX interchange is 
		mandatory. Then connect VCC and ground of this RFID and VCC and ground of zigbee module connected to it to 3.3v.
			Your structure is now ready to be used.
	
	
	Now on powering up the robots and zigbees and RFID that robot will move forward which RFID tag you'll swipe.
	
	
	
	
	You can further modify this code making various uses like an automatic car parking system where that car will come out of parking lot of which 
	RFID card you have swiped.
