This header files gives an easier way to access command mode commands.
This header file gives us functions which can be called as an alternative
 to giving different AT commands which should be given in Ascii and becomes
 a tedious process to understand and implement AT commands.
	We can refer to the data manual of zigbee and associate the respective 
function from this header file and thus implement the same in your program.
